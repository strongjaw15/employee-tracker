## Description

This app is an employee management program that runs a MySQL database. It uses a CLI in node js to operate the program. I wanted to build something that would let the user create work departments, roles, employees, and assign managers and salaries to the employees. This is a concise way to keep up-to-date employee data. I learned a lot aboout using MySQL while making this program.
